Hi,

Here is the 2014 competition. Have you heard about CAPTCHAs? Maybe not. But
you have seen them all over the internet for sure. Google CAPTCHA to learn 
more. 

Your task is to make a function called my_classifier.m that decodes three 
digits in an image. You have plenty of training data in imagedata/ and in 
labels.txt you have the ground truth decoding. 

Your solution should be programmed reasonably well so it terminates within 
5 minutes on the training data set. We will run your function my_classifier.m 
on our own data, which is similar but not identical to your training data. 
If you score above 40% average precision and fulfil the time condition, 
you pass the lab. See the enclosed script evaluate_classifier.m 
and the example my_classifier.m for an explanation of the expected formats.

You email your solution to the lab assistants (kristina.lidayova@it.uu.se, tomas.wilkinson@it.uu.se). 
It should at least include your own function my_classifier.m, your own estimate of its average
precision, the execution time of the method and your own cool team name. 
All results above 40% average precision will be posted on a high score list 
on the course homepage. Everybody that passes the requirements for this lab before
14th December 2014 will get 1 bonus point on the exam.

Of course you may ask questions, if something is unclear or too difficult.
We make this into a competition just for fun, it is not the hunger 
games... :-)
